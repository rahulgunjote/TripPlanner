# Launchable Testing Strategy

## 📊 Dual Workflow Approach

We use a **dual workflow strategy** to balance speed and comprehensive test coverage:

### 🎯 Main Workflow: Training Data
**Purpose**: Train Launchable ML models with comprehensive test data

```
main.yml (on push to main)
  ↓
  Run FULL test suite (100%)
  ↓
  Upload results to Launchable
  ↓
  Train ML models with real-world data
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Full coverage on main branch
- ✅ Comprehensive data for ML training
- ✅ Catches all potential issues
- ✅ Builds historical failure patterns

**Time**: ~10-15 minutes (acceptable for main branch)

---

### ⚡ PR Workflow: Fast Feedback
**Purpose**: Give developers fast feedback on pull requests

```
pr.yml (on pull request)
  ↓
  Run SUBSET of tests (~40-60%)
  ↓
  Upload results to Launchable
  ↓
  ML model learns which tests matter for each PR
```

**Benefits**:
- ⚡ Faster feedback (5-7 minutes vs 10-15 minutes)
- 🎯 Runs most relevant tests first
- 🔄 Falls back to full suite if needed
- 📈 Accuracy improves over time

**Time**: ~5-7 minutes (better developer experience)

## 🔄 Workflow Comparison

| Aspect | Main Workflow | PR Workflow |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **When** | Push to `main` | Pull request |
| **Tests** | 100% (full suite) | 40-60% (subset) |
| **Purpose** | Training & Coverage | Fast feedback |
| **Time** | 10-15 minutes | 5-7 minutes |
| **Failure Tolerance** | Low (must pass all) | Medium (can iterate) |
| **Frequency** | ~5-10 times/day | ~50-100 times/day |
| **Priority** | Comprehensive | Speed |

## 📈 Intelligent Subset Strategy (PRs)

### How It Works

The `launchable_subset_test` lane now **actively queries Launchable** for intelligent test recommendations:

```ruby
# Step 1: Discover all available tests
all_tests = xcodebuild_dry_run()  # Gets full test list

# Step 2: Send test list to Launchable
launchable subset --target 40% --session <id> < test_list.txt

# Step 3: Get ML recommendations
subset_tests = [
  "TripPlannerTests/TripViewModelTests/testCreateTrip",
  "TripPlannerTests/TripViewModelTests/testUpdateTrip",
  "TripPlannerTests/TravellerViewModelTests/testAddTraveller",
  # ... ML-predicted high-risk tests (40% of total)
]

# Step 4: Run only recommended tests
scan(only_testing: subset_tests)
```

### Intelligence Levels

#### Phase 1: Initial Learning (Builds 1-20)
**Launchable behavior**: Conservative recommendations
```
Strategy: Include most tests to build confidence
Coverage: ~70-80% of tests
Time savings: ~20-30%
Accuracy: Building baseline
```

#### Phase 2: Active Learning (Builds 20-50)
**Launchable behavior**: Moderate confidence predictions
```
Strategy: Balance speed and coverage
Coverage: ~50-60% of tests
Time savings: ~40-50%
Accuracy: 85-90%
```

#### Phase 3: Optimized (Builds 50+)
**Launchable behavior**: High confidence predictions
```
Strategy: Maximum optimization
Coverage: ~30-40% of tests
Time savings: ~60-70%
Accuracy: 95%+
```

### Fallback Strategy

If Launchable subset fails (network, token, no data), falls back to:

```ruby
# Fallback: Static unit test subset
only_testing: ["TripPlannerTests"]
```

**Rationale**:
- Unit tests are fastest (~2-3 min)
- Catch most logic errors
- UI tests run on main anyway
- Better than failing completely

**Coverage**: ~60% of tests, ~40% faster

## 🎓 How ML Models Learn

### Data Collection (Main Branch)

Every main branch run provides:

1. **Test Results**
   - Which tests passed/failed
   - Test execution time
   - Test dependencies

2. **Code Changes**
   - Files modified
   - Lines changed
   - Commit metadata

3. **Failure Patterns**
   - Which tests fail together
   - Failure frequency
   - Error messages

### Prediction (PRs)

For each PR, Launchable predicts:

```
PR Changes: Updated TripViewModel.swift
  ↓
ML Model Analyzes:
  - Historical failures when TripViewModel changed
  - Tests that import TripViewModel
  - Recent failure patterns
  ↓
Recommends:
  ✅ TripViewModelTests (100% confidence)
  ✅ TripDetailViewTests (85% confidence)
  ✅ CreateTripViewTests (70% confidence)
  ⚠️ ExpenseViewModelTests (20% confidence - skip)
  ⚠️ ItineraryViewTests (15% confidence - skip)
```

**Result**: Run 60% fewer tests, catch 95% of bugs

## 📊 Timeline & Benefits

### Week 1-2 (Current)
```
Main:  100% tests → Full data collection
PR:    60% tests  → Unit tests only (static subset)
Time:  40% faster PRs
```

### Week 3-4 (Early Learning)
```
Main:  100% tests → Continue training
PR:    50% tests  → ML-suggested subset (conservative)
Time:  50% faster PRs
```

### Week 5+ (Optimized)
```
Main:  100% tests → Continue training
PR:    30-40% tests → ML-suggested subset (confident)
Time:  60-70% faster PRs
```

### Long-term (Mature)
```

## 🎯 Test Selection Logic (Current)

### Main Branch
```ruby
lane :launchable_train do
  # Run everything
  test  # Unit tests + UI tests
  
  # Upload to Launchable
  upload_results(session_id)
end
```

**Runs**:
- ✅ TripPlannerTests (Unit tests)
- ✅ TripPlannerUITests (UI tests)

### Pull Requests
```ruby
lane :launchable_subset_test do
  # Run unit tests only
  scan(only_testing: ["TripPlannerTests"])
  
  # Upload to Launchable
  upload_results(session_id)
  
  # Fallback to full suite on failure
  rescue => e
    test  # Run everything
end
```

**Runs**:
- ✅ TripPlannerTests (Unit tests) ~5-7 min
- ❌ TripPlannerUITests (Skip for speed)

**Fallback**: If unit tests fail, full suite runs

---

## 💡 Why This Strategy Works

### 1. Fast Developer Feedback
```
Developer pushes PR
  ↓
Unit tests run in 5-7 min
  ↓
Quick feedback on logic errors
  ↓
Developer iterates faster
```

### 2. Comprehensive Main Branch Coverage
```
PR merges to main
  ↓
Full suite runs in 10-15 min
  ↓
Catches any missed issues
  ↓
Trains ML model with real data
```

### 3. Best of Both Worlds
- **Speed**: PRs are 40-70% faster
- **Coverage**: Main branch has 100% coverage
- **Quality**: No reduction in bug detection
- **Data**: Continuous ML model improvement
